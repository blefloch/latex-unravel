The `unravel` LaTeX package provides tools to explore TeX code,
performing expansion and assignments step by step.

This package requires up-to-date versions of the `l3kernel`,
`l3packages` and `l3experimental` bundles.

The package is extracted by running `pdflatex unravel.ins`.
For documentation, run `pdflatex unravel.dtx` twice.

This is work in progress, all suggestions/comments/bug reports are
welcome!
